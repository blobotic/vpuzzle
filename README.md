online singleplayer jigsaw puzzle // high resolution + piececount

inspired by: https://jigsawpuzzles.io/

concept:
- high piececount (> 1k/2k/4k pieces)
- custom pieces
- rotation?
- custom images (saves as image link)

we probably need:
- canvas? (zoom-in/out, pan, etc)
- efficient way to render pieces + move them
